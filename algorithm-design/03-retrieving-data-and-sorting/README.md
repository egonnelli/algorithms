# Sorting

1. Implement Insertion Sort and Quick Sort.
2. Implement Heap Sort by using binary heap implementation required by homework on heaps.
3. Implement Counting Sort, Radix Sort, and Bucket Sort.
4. Implement the Select Algorithm.
5. Test the implementations on a set of instances of the problem and evaluate their execution times.
6. Prove by testing that both Insertion Sort and Quick Sort take time O(n 2 ) in the worst case.
7. Prove by testing that Insertion Sort and Quick Sort take in the best case time O(n) and O(nlogn), respectively.
8. Why did we assume that there were no repeated values in A? Generalize the implementation of the Select Algorithm to also deal with repeated values.
