# Matrix Multiplication: Homework

1. Download the implementation of the Strassen’s algorithm from this link.
2. Unzip the code and compile it by using the command:

```linux
 cc -O4 -o strassen_test *.c
```
3. Improve the implementation of the Strassen’s algorithm by reducing the
memory allocations and test the effects on the execution time.
